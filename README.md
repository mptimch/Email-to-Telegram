<h1> Email-to-Telegram </h1>
<h2>Mini console app to send mails from Email to Telegram. You will need telegram token only </h2>
<br>
You can start the program, downloading jar or exe file. Just get this file to your PC and put file <b>config.properties</b> in the same folder.<br>
You can open config.properties with notepad and insert there your mail service, login, password, telegram token and telegram chat id.<br>

<br>
<h3>Some extra advices:</h3>
<b>Don't forget to make all settings in cnfig.properties</b>!!!<br>
For best working, make a special password for this application. Do not use login and password, that you use in browser. Find an "application passwords" setting in your email service<br>

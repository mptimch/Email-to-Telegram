# Email-to-Telegram
Mini console app to send mails from Email to Telegram. You will need telegram token only

Getting Telegram token is easy:
- Enter @BotFather in the search tab and choose the relevant bot.
- Click Start to activate the BotFather bot. You will receive a list of commands to manage the bots.
- Choose or type the /newbot command and click Send
- Choose a name for your bot. Next, choose a username for your bot. The bot can be found by its username in the search bar. The username must be unique and end with the word “bot.”
- After you choose a suitable name for your bot, the bot will be created
- You will receive a message with a link to your bot t.me/<bot_username>, recommendations to set up a profile picture, description of the profile, and a list of commands to manage your new bot.
Copy the token value. 


You can write me to Telegram @Mptimch with suggestions for improving the program.
Besides I am looking for a job and will be glad to any offers.
